Filter-Tweaks is a extension for Firefox that allows you to adjust CSS filters on webpages.
This was made to correct streams and add an artistic flare to others. The extension has sliders for hue, saturation, sepia, contrast and brightness. Also there is an audio gain filter as well as profiles that can be saved and loaded. This extension does not work with certain DDRM video players, Disney+ and Netflix currently do not work and I don't see a way to make them work in the future.
